  <h2>Raspberry Pi PPG</h2>
  <p>In this project I tested if I could measure PPG with a Raspberry Pi 4 (Model B) based system.<br>
    The working principle is that a red led is used as the light source, and a light transistor<br>
    measures the amount of light transmitted trough the finger. Raspberry Pi has only digital data <br>
    pins, and that is why a MCP3008 analog to digital converter is used for digitalizing the voltages <br>
    from the phototransistor. The measurement and analysis programs were implemented in Python.

  <p>The data is filtered and a naive peak detection is implemeted. The heart rate can be calculated <br>
    with the system. Currently no amplifier is used to enhance the signal. Also a some sort of concealed <br>
    clip has to be implemented to reduce the amount of ambient light hitting the phototransistor.
