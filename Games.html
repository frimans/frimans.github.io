  From here you can find my game developement projects. I have been learing game development in Unity, <br>
  which is a game engine with which development for multiple platforms is easy. The scripting language <br>
  used in Unity is C#, which is kinda similar to C++ I am familiar with. I find game develomnent fun and <br>
  highly educational process. It requires some coding knowledge, visual skills and imagination. <br>
  <br>
  Currently I have made two games. The first one is an WebGL build, meaning it runs on a webprowsers. <br>
  The game itself is mostly made from a fps template Unity provides for new developers as an starting point. <br>
  It is a shooter game, to which I applied some of my owns stuff and level design. The template can be found from <a class="linkedin_link" href="https://learn.unity.com/project/fps-template" target="_blank">HERE</a><br>
  <br>
  The other game I worked on recently, but currently it is on hold. It is a mobile platform game for android, which I have implemented from <br>
  the very beginning myself. The idea is that it contains multiple smaller games (fps, platformer...) in one. The change between <br>
  the games is done with this weird blue ball, with which the game is chosen. The game choosing is a game of kinda too... <br>
  Try it yourself!!<br>

  <br>
  The currently running game project is a 2D android game. This is also just for experimentation with the unity. I probably should have <br>
  started with 2D and after that moved to the 3d development. The game itself will be some kind of rythm game maybe.
